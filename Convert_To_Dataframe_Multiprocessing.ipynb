It\\'s so heavy, you seet Old Mother Nature waa taking a nice boat rid not very far from the Florida coast when she saw an odd fin come above the surface of the water. Many other persons would have wondered what Strang creature creature was swimming along so slowly, but the Jolly old lady 1 well acquainted acquainted with the habit of every living creature, so ahe knew It to be an ocean un fish. Now, there happen happen to be a great deal of difference between such a fish and the little sunflsh that may be caught In almost any creek or pond. This difference difference la In both size and shape. A few swift strokeR of th oars brought old Mother Nature alongside alongside the huge creature and the aun-flh aun-flh stopped swimming when she r w \\' 1 M-Lf. V - jt\",V1\\' \" mm \\' laughed and said: \"I\\'m glad to see that you are enjoying a morning swim, a you don\\'t often come to the surface unless the weather is very fine. At other time you prefer to brows around on the bottom of the ocean and feed upon seaweed. Almost anybody would think that a fish of your great size and weight would eat thousands of smaller sea creatures every week, but you seem to be a strict vegetarian. You do not get your name because of being bright colored, for you are a grayish grayish brown and nave no scales. Being Being so nearly round you look about as much like the aun a anything else. \"The other day I saw one of your cousins caught by a fisherman. It was a funny night to see him and several of his friends trying to hnul it through the water, but finally their boat reached the dock. Then the problem was to get the huge fellow out of the water. They tied ropes around Its body and huffed and puffed with all their might, but could not pull It upon the dock. Then they pulled It to a nearby derrick derrick which aoon hoisted the eunflsh and every one of them wer surprised surprised to find that It weighed 1.500 ponnds! You are really very comical and don\\'t seem to know 11. Why. you really look like only the head and shoulders of an odd fish with Just enough fins to give you a name.\" she concluded with a laugh.
